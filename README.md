# horiseon-refractor-repository

##My motivation for this project was to increase accessibility on the webpage to have a more pleasent experience on the page.
I built this project because I didn't like looking at the non-semantic elements in the source code so I wanted to replace them with semantic elements
There was a problem of accessibility with a broken link, a footer heading that was too big, and the addition of alternative attributes on the images
I learned many things about the benefits of having semantic elements over using non-semantic elements. 

##You can scroll down, click on the links, view the images and captions
